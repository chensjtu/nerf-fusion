# NSVF Example

NSVF is one of influential extended works based on NeRF. It incorperate explicit vol representation (of learnt features) with implicit MLP representation to provide the rendering speedups as well as editability of the scene.

However, the NSVF's original implementation is a bit complicated for beginners. We decided to re-implement NSVF here based on Accel-RF's workflow. 

**Note**: this NSVF may not be a 100% faithful re-implementation of the original NSVF, but it should be fully functional and efficient enough.
